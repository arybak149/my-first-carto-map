         <h5>CEDAW’s promise to counter gender discrimination</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
             by Agnieszka Rybak, MS Candidate, International Affairs at The New School - Julien J. Studley Graduate Program in International Affairs, Spring 2018.

            <br>
         
          
        
        
        <p>The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is 
          considered as the most comprehensive code of women’s rights at international level, with its 
          focus on socioeconomic, civil, political and cultural rights in all spheres of women’s lives. 
          CEDAW was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979, and countries 
          began to implement it on September 3, 1981. CEDAW’s ratification represents an important reaffirmation 
          of nation’s commitment to the human rights of women, and a momentous step forward for women around the world. 
          Furthermore, countries that have ratified the Convention are legally bound to put its provisions into practice. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Today, it is time to examine as to whether the promise of CEDAW was delivered as initially intended. 
          To rightly assess the success of CEDAW, it is imperative to ask the following questions: 1) Which countries have laws that promote gender equality? 
2) Which countries have laws preventing domestic violence against women? 
            3) Which countries grant equal rights for men and women on property ownership? 
4) Which countries have laws prohibiting sexual harassment at work and public space? </p><br>
<p>Using data from the World Bank and the UN, I created an interactive map to answer above 
  raised questions and provide a snapshot of how women's rights are legislated around the world. Additionally, to add a 
  much more in-depth dimension and urgency towards women’s rights issues 
  across the globe, I used the Gender Gap Index to identify the best and worst places for women. </p>

           <p>The map contains eight layers in total. Data for each layer was cleaned, re-organized and geocoded using ArcGIS Desktop. </p> <br>
<p>For “the women’s equality treaty layer,” I created InfoWindow (aka pop up text on mouse hover) to show each country’s name. </p><br> 
<p>For "women's rights around the world by issue layers,” I created bubbles in different color to show identified full, partial and non-positive and no data responses. </p><br>
<p>For “the best and worst places for women layer,” I used polygon pattern fill with the opacity at 75 %, so other layers could be visible and to add more in-depth dimension to the map.  </p>
